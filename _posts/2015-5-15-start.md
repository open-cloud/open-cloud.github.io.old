title: XOS Guide 
---

This guide gives an overview of XOS, including detailed information
about using, developing, and operating XOS. It also includes release
notes and a roadmap. This guide is an evolving document. We are using
it in lieu of a Wiki.

To help frame the discussion, this guide distinguishes among three
distinct but related terms:

* *Everything-as-a-Service (XaaS)* is the organizing principle that
  underlies XOS's design. 

* *XaaS Operating System (XOS)* is a Cloud OS that that implements the
  XaaS architecture.

* *OpenCloud* is an operational cloud that runs XOS and spans a set of
  servers distributed across multiple sites world-wide.

This guide is primarily about XOS, but it is often necessary to talk
about an operational deployment of XOS, in which case we use OpenCloud
as a representative example. It is most accurate to think of OpenCloud
as one use case built using XOS. Another important XOS use case is CORD
(Central Office Re-architected as a Datacenter).
